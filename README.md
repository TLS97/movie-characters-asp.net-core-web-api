# MovieCharactersAPI

This project is a part of the Noroff Accelerate course and is the third assignment in the .NET backend module. The project creates a database in SQL Server with an Entity Framework Code First workflow and is constructed in ASP.NET Core Web API to allow users to manipulate the data. This features Controllers, Services, Mappers and DTOs to create a datastore and interface to store and manipulate movie characters. The database stores information about characters, movies they appear in, and the franchises these movies belong to.

## Install

Download the repository or use git clone to install:
```
git clone git@gitlab.com:TLS97/noroff-assignment-5-dotnet.git
```

## Usage

Change connection string from appsettings.json and then open the Package Manager Console to run:
```

```

This command will create the database in SQL Server.
